# OnHive.io

Hive.io is an initiative started by [@mciszczon](https://ecency.com/@mciszczon)
to create a community-driven documentation site for the Hive blockchain.

The initial spark was the Hive Coding School idea that was created for the Decentralized Hive Fund proposal
by [@krolestwo](https://ecency.com/@krolestwo). It is a series of tutorials that teach you
how to build apps on the Hive blockchain.

## Getting involved

There are many ways to get involved with the Hive.io project. You can contribute to the documentation by
writing new content, fixing typos, or adding new tutorials.

This entire website is completely open source and built using Astro Starlight.
The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/instytutfi/onhive.io). Head there to
contribute to the project.

If you have any other ideas for how to contribute or make the site better, feel free to reach out
to [@mciszczon](https://ecency.com/@mciszczon) on the Hive blockchain.
