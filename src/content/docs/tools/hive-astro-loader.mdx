## About Astro

Astro is the web framework for building content-driven websites like blogs, marketing, and e-commerce.
Astro is best-known for pioneering a new frontend architecture to reduce JavaScript overhead and complexity
compared to other frameworks. If you need a website that loads fast and has great SEO, then Astro is for you.

### Content Layer API

The Content Layer API is a new feature of Astro that allows you to fetch content for the app from any source,
be it Markdown files, JSON, database, API or anything else.

Utilizing the Content Layer API, we can build a custom Astro loader that makes it very easy
to fetch and present content published on the Hive blockchain.
